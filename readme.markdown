jQuery dropdownNav Plugin
=============================

jQuery Plugin that turns a regular form select element into a keyboard accessible navigation element.
Inspired by http://www.themaninblue.com/experiment/AccessibleSelect/ which I found interesting but not
really accessible as it came without a non-js fallback.

Usage:
------
$(function() {
	$("form").dropdownNav();
});
